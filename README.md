# HousingPriceKaggle

This project is predicting sales price of houses. 

1. clfResultCJ.csv: only xgboost.XGBRegresoor
2. regResultCJ.csv: xgboost.XGBRegresoor after RandomizedSearchCV
3. annResultCJ.csv: ANN(deep learning)

These three models are used for training, and the second model got the best result, MSE(Mean Squared Error).
In this project, deep learning ANN got the worst result. (Deep learning seems like not always get the good result)
